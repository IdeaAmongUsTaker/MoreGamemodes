If you beat up guard, you get 100 resources and steal his weapon. When your health go down to 0, you get eliminated and respawn after some time. Guards can only attack wanted prisoners. Prisoner will become wanted, when he do something illegal near guard. Guards can use kill button on not wanted players to check them. If that player has illegal (red) item, he becomes wanted. When player is beaten up, he is no longer wanted. As guard you can buy things with money like prisoners craft. You can also repair wall in reactor by using shift button. If guard beat up prisoner, then prisoner lose all illegal items. Depending on options prisoners can help other after escaping.\nItems:\nResources - prisoners use it to craft items.\nScrewdriver (illegal) - gives prisoner ability to vent\nWeapon (illegal) - has 10 levels.

You can fill your breathing mask with oxygen in o2. In electrical prisoners get 2 resources per second. In storage prisoners get 5 resources per secons. Guards always get 2 dollars per second. There are 3 ways to escape:<br>1. Craft spaceship parts with resources. Then craft spaceship with them. Then fill it with fuel, go to storage and you escaped!<br>2. Craft breathing mask and pickaxe. Fill your breathing mask with oxygen. Then go to reactor and destroy a wall with your pickaxe. If you do it, you're free!<br>3.
